            <p>Environmental quality and particularly water quality is of primary concern to all. This nowhere more so than in arid environments. The west flank of the Andes and coastal desert in Peru is currently in an hyper-arid climatic phase and water is a scarce resource. Industrial development and consequent urbanization is accelerating in Peru. The concentration of people and industry on the arid littoral has intensified pressure on natural resources in the region, making Peru one of the most vulnerable countries to drought. Environmental quality and impact assessment are increasingly important regulatory components of statutory action across the globe. The development of rapid and accurate technologies and methods for environmental monitoring and impact analysis is now a global priority. As continuous monitoring is now required any new technologies and methods need to be cost effective as well as rapid and accurate. It is in this context that the University of Cambridge has started a program of investigating a range of new technologies and methods for Environmental Impact Analysis.

              <br>
              The principal objective of this collaboration is that the University of Cambridge (Cambridge), UK, in collaboration with the Universidad Nacional de Cañete (UNDC), based at Cañete, Peru, plan to establish the Cañete-Cambridge Institute of Environmental Physics (CCIEP) to investigate the impact of agricultural and industrial activities on environmental quality in Peru's San Vicente de Cañete region and develop impact assessment methods and technologies.</p>
