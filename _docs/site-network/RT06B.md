RT06B - Upper Yauyos

Site Code: RT06B.  GPS: S12°457210, W75°924855. Elevation:
2970m asl.

### Water Quality Data

The following river and water quality data was collected from this site: (to be added)

### Data Analysis

Discharge at this point on the Rio Yauyos was low suggesting that the rains had not yet started in the headwaters of this sub-catchment. 
At nearly 3000m asl the DO readings at T06b were lower than at many sites but fall within the range to be expected for a November data set. 
The conductivity readings at this site (164 µS/cm) was very low but is as expected for a high altitude site located above all settlements within a sub-catchment. It suggests good conditions for aquatic life.
The pH reading of 7.39 is slightly lower than at most other site in the valley. However, at these levels the alkalinity of the river is suitable for aquatic life and indicative of clean water. 

### Site description

Site T06b lies in the Rio Yauyos valley at 2970m asl, just above the settlement of Yauyos. The valley at this point is narrow with a v-shaped profile and a very narrow flood-plain. Channel bed load comprised of scattered large boulders, and stones. River flow in the Rio Yauyos is year-round and does deliver some input to the Rio Cañete. 
The study site is largely agricultural, dominated by eucalyptus and tall natural scrub along one bank, while the bank is lined with small fields and pasture animals are often corralled there.
Just upstream water enters the channel from an underground spring on one bank and also from an irrigation channel drawing water from further upstream on the other bank. In places the irrigation channel overflows and animals walk in it contaminating the water which then enters the river just above the study site. 
There are no permanent settlements higher up the valley and access is only by foot up a rough track.
