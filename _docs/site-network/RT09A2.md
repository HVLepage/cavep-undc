Site Code: RT09A2.  GPS: S12.267975, W75.771023. Elevation:
3384m asl.


### Water Quality Data



### Data Analysis
The discharge at this site on the Rio Alis was significant (5.7 cumecs) as a result of the combined upstream river discharge and manantial outflow.

At nearly 3400m asl the average DO reading at T9a2 (6.31mg/l) was within the range to be expected.

The conductivity reading at this site (649 ÂµS/cm) is as expected for a site located high in the drainage basin, above most settlements.

The pH reading of 7.64 is as expected. At these levels the alkalinity of the river is suitable for aquatic life. 


### Site Description
Site T9a2 lies in the Alis valley immediately downstream of the manantial at 3384m asl and just above a road bridge across the river. The valley at this point is narrow and very steep sided as is the main channel. 

The river bank at the site is overgrown with dense coniferous woodland which runs along the left bank.
