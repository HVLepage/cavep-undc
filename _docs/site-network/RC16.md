### Data Analysis

Discharge for the Rio Cañete at this point is constant as it is fed by a
series of bofedales lying beneath the remaining snowfields above.

At over 4200m asl the DO readings at RC16 fall within the range to be
expected. It again follows the pattern in which DO readings slowly fall
as elevation increases. The measurements for conductivity and total
solids are now low, reflecting the fact that channel flow is derived
from bofedales where it has been filtered. As there is only a low
population density above this point in the headwaters anthropic impact
is low. There is some pastoral agriculture associated with the town of
Tanta, which is more intensive close to the town.

### Site description

Site RC16 lies in the puna zone above the small town of Tanta at 4285m
asl. At this point the valley has a U-shaped profile typical of
glaciated landscapes and is dominated by the nearby snow-covered peaks
and valley bofedales. The bed load in the river channel is comprised of
fluvio-glacial boulders, gravels, and sands. The river flow in the Rio
Cañete is constant and year-round.

There is no agricultural cultivation taking place at present, with
pastoralism dominating any rural land use (See above). This area was always a transhumance focal point and
would have been more densely populated during the Inca empire and
earlier.

The principal anthropic impacts at this site would be overgrazing and
cutting of peat from the bofedales. The latter was always a destructive
process, impacting on water availability and quality as well as soil
erosion and flood risk and thus is another practice best avoided.

The flora and fauna at this elevation is dominated by high elevation
components and communities. In addition to those species mentioned so
far, the bofedale habitats also support a highly specialised fauna. This
might include Puna Tinamou, Rufous-bellied Seedsnipe, Diademed
Sandpiper-Plover, White-bellied Cinclodes, Olivaceous Thornbill,
Black-breasted Hillstar and Dark-winged Miner along with other Furnarids
and Tyrannids. The biodiversity of these bofedales is the subject of
on-going investigation.
