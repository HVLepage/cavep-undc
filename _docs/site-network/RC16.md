### Data Analysis
Discharge for the Rio Cañete at this point is fed by a series of bofedales located beneath the remaining glaciers highjer up the valley. This generates a consistent discharge of below one cumec. However, subsequent to heavy rainfall or sudden snow melt there may be a major increase as in November 2021 though this may well be a significant over-estimate of the discharge at this time.

At nearly 4300m asl the DO readings at RC16 fall within the range to be expected. They again follow the pattern in which DO readings slowly fall as elevation increases. The measurements for conductivity and total solids are low, reflecting the fact that channel flow is derived from bofedales where the water has been filtered. 

As there is only a low population density above this point in the headwaters anthropic impact is low. There is some pastoral agriculture associated with the town of Tanta, principally the keeping of large herds of alpcas, llamas and sheep on the surrounding bofedales which is more intensive close to the town.

### Site description
Site RC16 lies in the puna zone above the small town of Tanta at 4285m asl. At this point the valley has a U-shaped profile typical of glaciated landscapes and is dominated by the nearby snow-covered peaks and valley bofedales. The bed load in the river channel is comprised of fluvio-glacial boulders, gravels, and sands. The river flow in the Rio Cañete is constant and year-round. 

There is no agricultural cultivation taking place at present, with pastoralism dominating any rural land use. This area was always a transhumance focal point and would have been more densely populated during the Inca empire and earlier. 

The principal anthropic impacts at this site would be overgrazing and cutting of peat from the bofedales. The latter was always a destructive process, impacting on water availability and quality as well as soil erosion and flood risk and thus is another practice best avoided. 

The flora and fauna at this elevation is dominated by high elevation components and communities. In addition to those species mentioned so far, the bofedale habitats also support a highly specialised fauna. This might include Puna Tinamou, Rufous-bellied Seedsnipe, Diademed Sandpiper-Plover, White-bellied Cinclodes, Olivaceous Thornbill, Black-breasted Hillstar and Dark-winged Miner along with other Furnarids and Tyrannids. The biodiversity of these bofedales is the subject of on-going investigation.
