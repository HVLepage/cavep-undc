### Data Analysis
Discharge at this point along the Rio Canete did not increase July to November 2019, indicating rains had not started in the Rio Canete headwaters, in contrast to conditions in the lower tributary headwaters. The flow recorded may therefore represent base flow. The rains from the end of November to the end of March then recharge the catchment, and raise discharge to a peak in April. The sample point lies just below the confluence with the Rio Alis.                                                                                            

At over 3000m asl the DO readings at RC12 are low but fall within the range to be expected for both July and November 2019 data sets. The DO levels are very similar for both sample times. Conductivity readings at this site range from 457-527 µS/cm. This is high, but RC12 is in the upper mid-catchment.   

The pH readings of about 8.5 in November are as expected for a clean river and appropriate for most forms of aquatic life.
  
### Site Description
Site RC12 lies in the Rio Canete valley at 3032m asl in the arid temperate zone. It is just below the confluence with the Rio Alis at Tinco Alis. The valley at this point is narrow with a pronounced v-shaped profile and steep valley sides. River flow is year-round and fast at this point, although January to March flows are much greater.

The level flood-plain lands are only cultivated to a limited extent. There is some limited pastoralism and subsistence production of maize and quinua but little else. The riverbanks and nearby fields are lined with Alders, tall thorn scrub and scattered Eucalyptus sp. 

Above the narrow flood-plain valley sides are arid, supporting a xeric vegetation with increased woody shrubs and trees lining some of the more sheltered ravines. The north facing slope is rather more densely covered with shrubs and trees associated with the relictual pacific woodlands found a little higher up the valley. This site retains the typical avifauna of these elevations as outlined for sites RC10 and RC11.
