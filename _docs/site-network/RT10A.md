### Data Analysis
Discharge in the Rio Miraflores is year-round and as expected. The sub-catchment drains the three highest peaks with permanent snow cover, including both Llongote and Ticlla, in the area. 

At just above 3300m asl the DO readings at T10a are within the expected range and again follow the pattern of slowly falling as elevation increases. 

Conductivity and total solids measurements are lower, reflecting the scale of the sub-catchment and reduced input from weathering processes, consequently, water quality is good. 

pH values are above 8.5 but suited to the aquatic life species likely to be found at this altitude.


### Site Description
Sites T10a lies in the arid temperate zone below the small village of Miraflores at 3330m asl. At this point the valley has a sharply v-shaped profile and is more of a canyon in places with steep sides. 

The bed load in the river channel is comprised of fluvio-glacial boulders, gravels, and sands. Huge boulders from landslides also lie throughout the valley and along the river channel. 

There is significant agricultural cultivation on the lower slopes higher up the valley, while pastoralism dominates land use on the upper slopes. The valley lies within the Reserva Paisajistica Nor Yauyos-Cochas and the more inaccessible valley sides also have areas of pacific relictual woodlands.
