### Data analysis
The discharge at RC02B now contains the water that was diverted from the river at the Capillucas dam. It is still subject to hydro-electric plant control but appears to be maintained at a fairly constant 12-15 cumecs (the November 2021 figure is probably an over-estimation of velocity: approximately half that stated). The discharge at this point in the river is at its maximum because a short distance downstream a significant amount is abstracted at Bocatoma Socsi to supply the urban areas and irrigation projects on the coast strip.

There is some variation in the DO levels, with higher figures recorded in July.

Conductivity levels are as expected in the lower valley given that the river is now passing through several small towns and more expansive irrgiated areas draining into the river.

The average pH is over 8.0 which is ideal for aquatic life.


### Site description
RC02B is situated immediately upstream of Puente Socsi - the Socsi bridge. The right hand bank has been stabilised with large boulders creating an artificial bank. The left bank has been remodelled to accommodate the frequent arrival of whitewater rafting boats to deposit their passengers. Consequently, there is rubbish lining the bank.

Approximately 100 metres upstream the banks on both sides have reverted to their natural state lined with with extensive river cane, scattered acacia and stands of stunted willow. 

Beyond the vegetation lining the banks, both the small flood plain and wider river terraces are intensively farmed, principally with grapes and a range of fruit trees.
