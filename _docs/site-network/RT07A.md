### Data Analysis
Discharge at this point on the Rio Huantan varies according to the weather conditions in the high sierra, 30-40kms upriver. The July 2022 discharge, unlike the July 2019 discharge still reflects the seasonal rainfall earlier in the year while the November 2021 dischrage reflects the early onset of the rains in the headwaters of this sub-catchment that year. 

At just over 2400m asl the DO readings at RT07A fall within the range to be expected for both July and November data sets. Again, the increased elevation and diurnal fluctuations in temperature in narrow, sheltered sections of the valley will produce fluctuations in maximum absolute oxygen capacity and, consequently, the percentage saturation. This then fluctuates with that rhythm accordingly. 

The conductivity readings at this site (173-289 µS/cm) are as expected for a sub-catchment at this elevation.    

Average pH readings approaching 8.5 are as expected. At these levels the alkalinity of the river is highly suitable for aquatic life and indicative of clean water.


### Site Description
Site RT07A lies in the Rio Huantan valley at 2572m asl and just above the confluence with the Rio Cañete. It is located in the upper sub-tropics, above the settlement of Tinco in a picturesque valley. The valley at this point is very narrow with a pronounced v-shaped profile and steep river cliffs cut down through highly fractured strata. Bed load in the river channel is comprised of rocks predominantly with huge boulders. River flow in the Rio Huantan is year-round and delivers a not insignificant proportion of river discharge at this point in the catchment. 

There is little or no agricultural cultivation along this section of the Rio Huantan. The study site is dominated by riparian Alders, Agaves, and tall thorn scrub. Above the narrow flood plain valley sides are arid, supporting a xeric vegetation with increased woody shrubs and trees lining some of the more sheltered ravines. The lack of agricultural activity results from the lack of level ground and dominance of rocks and boulders lying across the steep slopes. This site retains the typical avifauna of the lower elevations with Scrub Blackbird, Black-necked Woodpecker, Golden Grosbeak, Chiguanco Thrush, House Wren, and Hooded Siskin being species that reflect a transitional community between the sub-tropics and temperature zone.    

In the upper parts of this sub-catchment agriculture is low intensity and traditional, the rural population is very low having been subject to rural drift. However, in the middle valley, the village of Huantan has retained much of its population due to a thriving dairy industry. In the headwaters there is a mining camp at Anexo Atcas. This mine may impact water quality in the Rio Huantan as might the Mina Corihuami located on the Rio Huantan watershed.
