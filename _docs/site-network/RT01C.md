Site Code: RT01B.  GPS: S12°923350, W75°712100. Elevation:
37070m asl.

### Water Quality Data

The following river and water quality data was collected from this site: (to be added)

### Data Analysis  

Discharge at this point along the Rio Viñak was not high. Channel flow perhaps primarily derived from ground-water as channels immediately below the headwater bofedale were dry. This does suggest that the wet season had not begun in the headwaters of this subcatchment.  
At just over 3700m asl the DO readings at T01b fall well within the range expected at this elevation.
The conductivity reading at this site was higher than might be expected (1050 µS/cm), possibly due to the fact that channel appeared to be dominated by ground water input.      
An average pH reading of 8.1 in November 2021, is as expected and at a level suitable for life.  

### Site description

Site T01b lies in the Rio Viñak valley at 3707m asl above all settlement and most agriculture in the valley. Above this sample point lands are extensively grazed with little or no cultivated lands while below some hillsides are terraced and most land cultivated. 
At this point the valley has narrowed to a gulley with a distinct v-shaped profile.  
Bed load in the river channel is comprised of scattered large boulders and smaller stones. River flow in the Rio Viñak is year-round but delivers a minimal input to the Rio Ca\~nete. 
The minimal input to the main Rio Canete channel is largely due to the high levels of water abstraction for terraced agriculture associated with the many settlements in the valley; including Huangascar, Viñak  and Madean.
The study site is dominated by puna grasses and scrub but little or no aquatic plant life.
