The fluctuations in discharge throughout the catchment reflect localised abstraction. 

At just over 4,000m asl the DO readings at RC15C

At this point the valley enters a narrow 
This reflects the fact that we are reaching the headwaters and clearly glaciated landscapes.
The bed load in the river channel is comprised of sands, gravels, and smaller boulders.
