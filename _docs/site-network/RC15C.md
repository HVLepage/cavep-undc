### Data Analysis
Discharge at this point was minimal - only a trickle (July 2022). It would appear from the build up of deposits that there was a greater outflow in the past.

The alkalinity levels are very high reflecting a significant level of dissolved carbonates in the water.

The population density above Puente Vilca is very low so, overall,the impact of anthropic activity is minimal though visitors (bathers) to the spring may have an impact on the water quality.

  
### Site Descriptions 
Site RC15C lies at nearly 4,200m asl in a more open section of the valley which reflects the fact that we are nearing the headwaters with clearly glaciated landscapes.

The site is a spring showing significant signs of geological activity and most probably gethermal activity in the past though the spring waters are no longer warm. 

There is no agricultural activity in the valley or on the valley sides, extensive pastoralism dominates rural land use throughout the headwater areas.
