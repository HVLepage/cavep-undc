### Data Analysis
Discharge at this site is impacted by the catchment hydroelectric water management system. This site is bypassed by the tunnel system that connects the Capillucas and lower El Platanal reservoirs. 

At just over 1000m asl the DO readings at RC04 are as expected for both the July and November 2019 data sets. The raised elevation and great fluctuations in daily temperatures in such narrow and sheltered valleys will produce fluctuations in maximum absolute oxygen capacity and, consequently, the percentage saturation that therefore fluctuates with that rhythm. At DO levels from 6.14-7.28 mg/l and 85-93% oxygen saturation aquatic vertebrates survive and invertebrates thrive. 

The conductivity reading at this site is 395-452 µS/cm. The level of conductivity in the Rio Ca\~nete at RC04 might be an indicator of limited contamination from waste waters and agricultural runoff. 

A pH of well over 8.0 is what would be expected and is suitable for aquatic life. It does not approach the tolerances of most aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates. 

### Site Description
Site RC04 is located below the town of Catahuasi in the arid upper tropics. The Rio Canete, at this point, is downriver of limited intensively farmed lands. The use of pesticides and fertilizers is probably only higher in the various sub-catchments in the temperate zone. The valley has a narrow steeply v-shaped profile with a tall river cliff on the north bank, indicating earlier periods of significant flooding perhaps at the end of the last Ice age. As elsewhere in the drainage basin discharge is highly seasonal. Discharge measurements in February-March are considerably greater. The channel itself is choked with large boulders and rocks from land slides and earlier flooding events. 

The banks are lined with scattered willow. The cultivation of crops is exclusively for subsistence farming in the marginal social groups forced onto the poorer soils. The production of maize, bananas dominate with smaller areas of avocado production. As with elsewhere in the catchment there is little or no natural vegetation remaining. The fauna and flora in the valley are depauperate with relictual west flanks endemics. The impact of water quality on the health of the environment and populations of wildlife occupying these lands is the subject of some aspects of our study here. There is a trout hatchery at this site which is fed by a nearby spring.
