title: RC00 - Rio Cañete Estuary

---

This site has been sampled at two points. RC00a and RC00b. These sites are very different in character. Sample point RC00a, indicated by a blue point on the above image principally flows from the village of Herbay Bajo and associated lands. The sample point RC00b, indicated by a red point on the above image better represents the cumulative character of the water geochemistry for the catchment as a whole.

It should be noted that the geochemical character of channel water is increasingly determined by local natural and anthropogenic factors as one descends to the estuary, notwithstanding the constant input of ground waters. That is, since a high proportion of water is abstracted in the upper and mid-catchment for irrigation thereby reducing the impact of those sections of the drainage basin. Thus, it is conditions within each discreet area that are more important for the analysis of water geo-chemistry. As such, even in the lower catchment from RC00 to RC03 it seems to be the case that local geological character and local anthropic activities obtain a greater significance that they might were conditions in the mid and upper catchment less disturbed.

### Site RC00a. Rio Canete estuary – Herbay Bajo (South side) 

### Data Analysis
It is the case that the amount of dissolved oxygen at 100% saturation at sea level and at 20°C would be 9.03 mg/L. However, at 4.42-4.79mg/l the DO reading are on the low side. As both water and atmospheric temperature was 19.16-20.0°C significant factors are reducing DO levels at this site. At 4.5mg/l dissolved oxygen and 50% oxygen saturation aquatic vertebrates survive and invertebrates thrive. High concentrations of nutrients (particularly phosphorus and nitrogen) fuel algae blooms, which initially boosts dissolved oxygen levels but then rapidly reduce DO. When the algae die, bacterial decomposition spikes, using up most or all of the dissolved oxygen available. This creates an anoxic, or oxygen-depleted, environment where few organisms survive. Such nutrient levels can occur naturally but are more often caused by pollution from fertilizer runoff or poorly treated wastewaters which could apply to this site below Herbay Bajo. At these recorded levels, denitrification takes place as bacteria use nitrates to decompose organic matter. These conditions are referred to as ‘dead zones’ and are often found near larger human populations in estuaries and coastal zones. 

The Conductivity reading at this site is 689-700 µS/cm. The level of conductivity in the Rio Canete at RC-00 is an indicator of significant contamination from waste waters and agricultural runoff. Generally, agricultural runoff and sewage will increase conductivity due to the additional chloride, phosphate and nitrate ions. The Nitrate levels recorded at RC-00 were 2.2mg/l. NO3. Throughout the catchment nitrate levels ranged from ‘under range’ to 6.79mg/l NO3 perhaps emphasizing the limited significance of both irrigated agriculture and sewage outfall from urban areas.   

At pH 5.4-5.5 the acidity of river waters is well withing the tolerance limit for life and not approaching the tolerances of most aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates. However, the July 2019 need to be confirmed.


### Site description
Site RC00a is located downstream from the new PanAmerican highway bridge on the south side of the channel. It is almost at sea level in the arid tropical zone. The Rio Canete at this point is lined with scrub and less intensively farmed areas as a consequence of the impact of both catastrophic flooding and marine ingression. The village of Herbay Bajo is situated above the river and atop a river cliff on the south side of the channel. Within a few hundred meters land is irrigated and agriculture of an intensive industrial nature. The valley at this point is a broad flat flood-plain to the north bounded to the south by a steep river cliff. The channel flow is highly variable from the dry season to the wet season, depending on water abstraction for agriculture and urban demand. The channel itself is highly braided at this time and made up largely of gravel and smaller boulders. The river does hold water year-round. Discharge at the end of September is low at the sample point at about 4.5 m³/s but would be 12 m³/s were no water abstracted. During the wet season discharge is considerably higher. 

The banks are lined with river cane and scattered areas of stunted willow. Cultivation a short distance up river is intense and fully irrigated. The production of potatoes, maize, ajo (garlic), aji (peppers), avocado dominates land use. There are smaller areas of sugar cane, a crop which dominates land use in, for example, the lower Fortaleza valley. There is little or no natural vegetation remaining in the lower valley and much of what was open desert has been irrigated and no highly productive agricultural lands. The water quality in the river at lower elevations is impacted by agricultural run-off and sewage disposal. The wider environment and fauna in the valley are largely determined by agriculture with many species expanding their range and abundance to occupy newly created agricultural lands. Desert fauna and flora has decreased accordingly.

The Rio Canete estuary is very important for the reproduction of Cryphiops caementarius, the Northern River shrimp. It is also an important site for breeding and migratory species of birds. As such the quality of water at this site requires careful monitoring. Many factors are instrumental in determining water quality in the estuary.  

As part of our field work we have collected specimens of Northern River Shrimp, Cryphiops caementarius to assess the trophic transfer of trace metals. We aimed to collect 350gm of muscle flesh and a similar weight of carapace from however many individuals we needed to catch. Employing local fisherman we arranged for him to catch the necessary number of River Shrimps at RC00b and two other sites in the lower catchment; Puente Socsi (RC-02b) and Puente Catapalla (RC-02c).

### Data Analysis
It is the case that the amount of dissolved oxygen at 100% saturation at sea level and at 20°C would be 9.03 mg/L. However, at 4.42-4.79mg/l the DO reading are on the low side. As both water and atmospheric temperature was 22.2-24.5°C there are some factors reducing DO levels at this site. At 4.42-4.79mg/l dissolved oxygen and 50% oxygen saturation aquatic vertebrates survive and invertebrates thrive. High concentrations of nutrients (particularly phosphorus and nitrogen) fuel algae blooms, which initially boosts dissolved oxygen levels but then rapidly reduce DO.

At these recorded levels, denitrification takes place as bacteria use nitrates to decompose organic matter. These conditions are referred to as ‘dead zones’ and are often found near larger human populations in estuaries and coastal zones. 

The Conductivity reading at this site is 489-510 µS/cm. The level of conductivity in the Rio Canete at RC00b is an indicator of some contamination from waste waters and agricultural runoff. This is however, lower than that found at Herbay Bajo, where sewage would be expected to raise conductivity. Generally, agricultural runoff and sewage will increase conductivity due to the additional chloride, phosphate and nitrate ions. Nitrate levels recorded at RC00b were also lower. Throughout the catchment nitrate levels ranged from ‘under range’ to 6.79mg/l NO3 perhaps underlining the limited extent of agriculture in the catchment. 

At pH 8.55-8.79 the acidity of river waters is ideal for aquatic life and not approaching the tolerances of most aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates.

### Site description
Site RC00b is located downstream of the PanAmerican highway on the north side of the river channel. It is almost at sea level and is in the tropical zone. The Rio Canete at this point is downriver of intensively farmed lands irrigated by waters extracted from the river at several points higher up. The valley at this point is a broad flat flood-plain to the north bounded to the south by a steep river cliff.  The channel flow is highly variable from the dry season to the wet season, depending on water abstraction for agriculture and urban demand from the various abstraction points. The channel itself is highly braided at this time and made up largely of gravel and smaller boulders but the river has a significabt discharge year-round. Discharge at the end of November is about 11.2 m³/s but would be 15 m³/s were no water abstracted. During the wet season discharge is considerably higher. 

The banks are lined with river cane and scattered areas of stunted willow. Cultivated is intense at this elevation. The production of cotton, grapes, maize, ajo (garlic), aji (peppers), avocado dominates land use. There are smaller areas of sugar cane, a crop which dominates land use further north. There is little or no natural vegetation remaining in the lower valley and much of what was open desert has been irrigated and no highly productive agricultural lands. The water quality in the river at lower elevations is severely impacted by agricultural run-off and sewage disposal. The wider environment and fauna in the valley are largely determined by agriculture with many species expanding their range and abundance to occupy newly created agricultural lands. Desert fauna and flora has decreased accordingly.
