### Data Analysis
Discharge fluctuations at this point along the Rio Alis reflect the timing, with discharge slowing and reducing as the dry season progresses. 

At well over 3200m asl the DO readings at RT09A fall within the range to be expected. The significantly higher water temperature in November 2019 may help to explain the lower DO level.

The measurements for conductivity and total solids are slightly on the high side and may reflect the fact that this site lies below a more significant settlement - the small town of Alis. Sewage outfall and other pollutants from domestic waste may enter the channel here. However, despite this the readings for water quality are still good.

Average pH readings of above 8.0 are as expected. At these levels the alkalinity of the river is suitable for aquatic life.


### Site Description
Sites RT09A lies in the arid temperate zone just below the small town of Alis at 3231m asl. It is located in the temperate zone in a narrow canyon. This being produced by rapid downcutting through a highly fractured upfold. The valley at this point is v-shaped with high sections of cliffs lining the valley.  Above this point the valley widens out at the site of the settlement of Alis. The bed load in the river channel is comprised of fluvio-glacial boulders, gravels, and sands. The river flow in the Rio Alis is year-round, despite having been reduced by significant abstraction to supply the village of Alis. 

There is limited agricultural cultivation. Historically, the terraced valleys would have been cultivated more intensively. Changes in agricultural production reflecting population decline in both the early period of Hispanic colonisation and, more recently, rural out-migration. There is limited pastoralism and field rotation employed for the production of potatoes and quinua. 

The riverbanks are dominated by riparian scrub and small alders with stands of Eucalypts. Above the uneven flood-plain valley sides are dominated by arid scrub and relictual pacific woodlands in sheltered ravines. This site displays a fauna and flora typical of temperate elevations. 

Chiguanco Thrush, House Wren and Hooded Siskin bird species remain. Cream-winged and White-winged Cinclodes, Striated Earthcreeper, Peruvian Sierra Finch, Plumbeous Sierra Finch, Band-tailed and Plain-coloured Seedeaters, and Black-throated Flowerpiercer are common here.
