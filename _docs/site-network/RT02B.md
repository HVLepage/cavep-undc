### Data analysis
Discharge at this point on the Rio Lincha suggested that there had been recent rains in the headwaters of this large sub-catchment. 

At 3500m asl the average DO reading (4.5 mg/l) at T2B was lower than at many sites but falls within the range to be expected.

The conductivity readings (262 µS/cm) were as expected for a high altitude site located above all settlements within a sub-catchment. It suggests good conditions for aquatic life.

The pH reading of 8.61 is good and suggests that the alkalinity of the river is suitable for aquatic life and indicative of clean water. 


### Site description
Site T2B lies at 3500m asl, just above the settlement of Lincha. The valley at this point is narrow with a v-shaped profile, with a small waterfall just upstream from the site and  almost no flood-plain. 

Channel bed load comprises of scattered large boulders, and stones. River flow in the Rio Lincha is year-round and delivers some significant input to the Rio Cañete. 

The land surrounding the study site is largely agricultural with small fields and pasture animals often grazed there, while eucalyptus and tall natural scrub dominate less accessible areas.

Much higher upstream it is believed that water enters via a tributary channel from an underground spring but any significant mineral contributions are still to be determined.

There are no permanent settlements higher up the valley and access is only by foot up a rough track.
