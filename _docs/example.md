In the code that is hidden abobe this line, change the title and permalink to this document. A permalink is the address that will show after the default URL. In this case, the permalink to this particular documents will be **[https://unam.ep.phy.cam.ac.uk/docs/example](https://unam.ep.phy.cam.ac.uk/docs/example)** simply change the example part to whatever you want. I suggest using the site code (i.e. /docs/RC00/ )

Below is an example formatting for a site description. You can replace all of this text with your own info on the sites.

NOTE: There is a part where I embed some images. To have them side by side, I put them in a table. We can discuss how to use tables if you are interested in this, it's not too hard, you just define columns with the vertical line symbol.

### Site description
Site A1 is located below the Puente Bolivar just below the city of Barranca at sea level in the tropical zone. The Rio Pativilca at this point is lined with intensively farmed lands irrigated by waters extracted from the river at several points higher up. The city of Barranca is situated just above the river cliff on the south side of the channel. The valley at this point is a broad flat flood plain to the north bounded to the south by a steep river cliff.  The channel flow is highly variable from the dry season to the wet season, depending on water abstraction for agriculture and urban demand from the various Bocatoma. The channel itself is highly braided at this time and made up largely of gravel and smaller boulders. The river does hold water year-round. Discharge at the end of September is low at the sample point at about 3.2 cubic meters per second but would be 9 cubic meters per second were no water taken out. During the wet season discharge is considerably higher. The banks are lined with river cane and scattered areas of stunted willow. Cultivated is intense at this elevation. The production of potatoes, maize, ajo (garlic), aji (peppers), avocado dominates land use. There are smaller areas of sugar cane, a crop which dominates land use in the lower Fortaleza valley. There is little or no natural vegetation remaining in the lower valley and much of what was open desert has been irrigated and no highly productive agricultural lands. The water quality in the river at lower elevations is severely impacted by agricultural run-off and sewage disposal. The wider environment and fauna in the valley are largely determined by agriculture with many species expanding their range and abundance to occupy newly created agricultural lands. Desert fauna and flora has decreased accordingly. The impact of water quality on the health of the environment and populations of wildlife occupying these lands is the subject of some aspects of our study here.

The following river and water quality data was collected from this site. 

**Water/river data summary**.  Data/time collected: 25-09-18 at 10.20
River discharge.  Width – 23.1m.  Depth (x5) 0.25, 0.35, 0.25, 0.3, 0.23.  Velocity 0.47, 0.73, 0.65, 0.55, 0.48 (metres per second).  Cross sectional area of 6.37m2 and an average velocity of 0.576m/s, giving a discharge of 3.8 cubic metres per second.  This is of interest as the Bocatoma Vinta was extracting 3.5 cubic meters per second at this time for irrigation and domestic consumption.  

**River bed type**.  Stones and Boulders.  The channel is braided, as can be seen from the above image.
Temperature; Atmospheric – 18.2 C,  River water 13.7C

**Atmospheric pressure** –  1013mbar  
**Dissolved Oxygen.**  2.5Mg/l,   27.4%  
**pH** – 8.39  
**Conductivity** (micro siemens) 1389  
**Total solids** (ppm) 695  
**ORP** (millivolts) 141  
**Turbidity** FNU – Not taken.   
**PSU** – Not taken.  
**Test strips** - Fe mg/l 0.0, Cu mg/l – 0.0, NH4 mg/l – 0.0.  
**Alkalinity** (mg/l CaCO3) Pink to colourless 0.0, Green to pink 190  (Cartridge used – 1.6N).   

**Nitrate cell tests**  
**Nitrates**. Mg/l NO3 – 33.7, mg/l,  N03-N 7.6  (quality check – 34.9mg/l NO3, 7.9 NO3-N)   
**Ammonia**. Mg/l NH4 – under range, mg/l NH4-N – under range. (Quality check – over range for both).

### Data Analysis
It is the case that the amount of dissolved oxygen at 100% saturation at sea level and at 20° C would be 9.03 mg/L. Water temperature was lower, at 13.7C but clearly significant factors are reducing DO levels at these elevations. At 2.5mg/l dissolved oxygen and 27.4% oxygen saturation few aquatic vertebrates can survive and some invertebrates begin to struggle. High concentrations of nutrients (particularly phosphorus and nitrogen) fuel algae blooms, which initially boosts dissolved oxygen levels but then rapidly reduce DO. When the algae die, bacterial decomposition spikes, using up most or all of the dissolved oxygen available. This creates an anoxic, or oxygen-depleted, environment where few organisms survive. Such nutrient levels can occur naturally but are more often caused by pollution from fertilizer runoff or poorly treated wastewaters which certainly applies to the lower Rio Pativilca below Barranca. At these recorded levels, denitrification takes place as bacteria use nitrates to decompose organic matter. These conditions are referred to as ‘dead zones’ and are often found near larger human populations in estuaries and coastal zones. 

The Conductivity reading at this site is at least twice that of most other river sites, equal to that found in the un-named stream at A14. This stream runs from mines in the upper catchment of the Rio Quero. The dramatically higher level of conductivity in the Rio Pativilca at A1 is another indicator of high levels of pollution. Generally, agricultural runoff and sewage will increase conductivity due to the additional chloride, phosphate and nitrate ions. The Nitrate levels recorded at A1 were significantly higher than recorded anywhere else in the catchment at 33.7mg/l. NO3. Throughout the catchment nitrate levels ranged from ‘under range’ to 2.4mg/l NO3 emphasizing the significance of both irrigated agriculture and sewage outfall from the city of Barranca.  

At pH 8.39 the alkalinity of river waters is nearing the upper tolerance limit for life but nevertheless falling within the tolerances of most aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates.
