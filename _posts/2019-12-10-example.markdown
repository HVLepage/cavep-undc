This is an example post format. The small bit above this text is only visible in the source file. Change the title, date, and author. Leave the category as is unless not field work. (The website will sort these automatically).

Here you can put a brief description of each visit (or each day). You can also embed an image this way:
![Measuring river discharge](/assets/posts/july2019.jpeg)

The part in the square brackets is the image description. The part in the parentheses is the path to the file. Here, only change the filename i.e. the "july2019.jpeg" part.
