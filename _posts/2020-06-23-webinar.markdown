Title:  Remote sensing and environmental change of the Ca単ete valley

Abstract: We use satellite images to analyze the vegetation around the Ca単ete Valley. Vegetation indices provide a quantitative measure for vegetation cover as well as large-scale changes in the past 20 years. We find two major types of changes. One is caused by seasonality and the other is a response to trend changes over the past two decades. We identify key points of interest along the Rio Ca単ete and its associated tributaries. We also promote the need for gathering ground truth information to confirm hypotheses that arise from remote sensing observations.
