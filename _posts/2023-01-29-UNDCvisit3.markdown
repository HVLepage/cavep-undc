Project director Eustace Barnes took the UNDC visitors - Betsabe, Edwin and Miriam – in to the Cambridgeshire countryside to look at –
-Landscape management practices and the value of remote sensing. 
-Environmental processes and associated research themes. 

They visited Wicken Fen, the Ouse Washes RSPB reserve and typical farmland of the area.

Firstly, the visit to Wicken Fen allowed a contrast of traditional semi-natural landscape – the fens - with the current managed farmed landscape to be made. The Fens are a very large, flat low-lying area of eastern England that was once marshland but was mostly drained and has been used for agriculture since the 17th century. The team discussed soils, drainage and land use patterns in this manmade landscape. 

Secondly, a visit was made to the Ouse Washes Bird reserve. There is was possible to see the change in land levels since the Fens were drained. The various current land uses were clearly visible in the lower lying and intensively farmed lands adjacent to the remaining fens. The latter almost 10m above the level of the farmland and clearly managed in a traditional manner with livestock.

A visit was also made to Ely cathedral.

On their return to Cambridge, a visit was made to the Cambridge Science Park to observe the close connections between the research capabilities that exist at the University of Cambridge and the technological and economic opportunities that arise from these links with world leading technology and pharmaceutical companies.
The day concluded with discussions about research opportunities at UNDC in which the following research themes were discussed:

*The concentration and dispersion of trace metals and associated residues from pesticides and fertilizers in irrigated lands in the lower Cañete valley.  

*Remote Sensing and geospatial variation in vegetative productivity and soil characteristics connected to anthropogenic land management practices and climate change.  

*The Andean river shrimp as a bioindicator.

All these opportunities could involve co-ordinated research between staff at the UNDC and the UCAM.
