E.Barnes (UCAM) demonstrates to UNDC staff and students how to deploy a drone to record footage of the study sites and their immediate surroundings. 
UNDC staff and students were able to take the controls and 'fly' the drone and almost immediately proved very adept at managing landings and take offs.
